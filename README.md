This app is designed to process the data UK vet schools received in 2023 regarding the Vet GDP Graduate and Advisers survey.

You can find the app here: [https://edin.ac/3PSpWhs](https://edin.ac/3PSpWhs)

The analysis within the app will provide schools with comparable analyses to R(D)SVS approach. It will not provide R(D)SVS with your school's data. The app will not share any data or processed reports with R(D)SVS. 

We have found this analysis useful for accreditation purposes and hope to make our approach available to others, as part of an enhancement led approach to quality assurance (see [VetEd 2023](https://www.ed.ac.uk/vet/news-events/new-events/veted-2023) talk *Quality Work: How enhancement led approaches to teaching data can reduce workload, improve outcomes, and deliver rainbows and kittens for all* by Jill MacKay).

If you find this app useful, we would love to hear about it. Please let Jill know.
